# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview of Project
As people born between 1946-1964 begin to retire at rapid rates, companies must prepare for a mass vacancy of jobs. With the use of SQL, analyze company data to determine the number of retiring employees per job title. Then, find all employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. Finally, deduce if there are enough retirement-ready employees to mentor eligible employees at each department. 

## Results

- Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
     - Yes, there are enough qualified, retiremnet-ready employees to mentor the next generation. I created a new table to display counts of mentorship-eligible employees and ordered it by title. Then, I compared the new table, "Mentorship Titles" with the "Retiring Titles" table from above. There are at least 70% or more current employees who will retire soon that will be able to mentor the eligible 1,464 employeees.
